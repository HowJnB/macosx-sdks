	@class		DRMSF
	@abstract	Representation of a time interval expressed in minutes, seconds and frames. 
	@discussion	In CD/DVD-land, minutes/seconds/frames are used to identify positioning on a disc (which is 
				most useful on an audio disc), but applies to any position on a disc no matter what type of 
				data is present.
				
				A frame is equivalent to a sector or block in normal disk parlance. 75 frames make up one
				second, so a 2 second pause (typical pregap size) is 150 frames.

	@method		descriptionWithFormat
	@abstract	Returns a textual representation of the receiver.
	@discussion	The format string is very similar to
				a printf-style format string with %-escaped formatting characters.
				
				<ul>
				<li>%%	A "%" character</li>
				<li>%m	Minutes as a decimal number</li>
				<li>%s	Seconds as a decimal number</li>
				<li>%f	Frames as a decimal number</li>
				</ul>
				
				In addition to these formatting characters an optional length specifier can come between then
				% and the formatting character. This length specifier will force the field in question to 
				be at least that wide. for example a format specifier of "%02m:%02s" will cause a 
				DRMSF object representing 3 minutes 9 seconds to be formatted as "03:09". 
			
				A formatter is aware of and respects rounding. If a bit of the msf is no zero, but the format
				does not display that value, the next higher value will be increased by one to reflect that.
				Extending our example above, an DRMSF with a value of 3 minutes, 9 seconds, 15 frames using a 
				format specfier of "%02m:%02s", will be formatted as "03:10" since the 15 frames rounds up the
				seconds to the next value
	@param		format	The format of the description string.
	@result		a new DRMSF object totalling the difference of the reciever and msf
