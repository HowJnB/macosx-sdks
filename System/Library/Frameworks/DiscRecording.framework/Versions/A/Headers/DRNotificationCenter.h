	@class 		DRNotificationCenter
	@discussion	A DRNotificationCenter object (or simply, notification center) is
				essentially a notification dispatch table. It notifies all observers of
				notifications meeting specific criteria. This information is encapsulated in
				NSNotification objects, also known as notifications. Client objects register
				themselves with the notification center as observers of specific notifications
				posted by DiscRecording. When an event occurs, DiscRecording posts an appropriate
				notification to the notification center. The notification center dispatches a
				message to each registered observer, passing the notification as the sole
				argument.
				
				There are two main differences between a DRNotificationCenter and the
				NSNotificationCenter from Foundation. First is that only DiscRecording
				posts notifications received through this mechanism. You use this to 
				obtain device plug/unplug events, burn status, etc. Second, there can be
				multple notification centers active at once. Each run loop of your application
				will have it's own notification center and notifications from that notification
				center will be posted to the runloop it was created on.

	@method			addObserver:selector:name:object:
	@abstract		Adds an observer to the receiver.
	@discussion		Registers anObserver to receive notifications with the name notificationName
					and/or containing anObject. When a notification of name notificationName
					containing the object anObject is posted, anObserver receives an aSelector
					message with this notification as the argument. The method for the selector
					specified in aSelector must have one and only one argument. If notificationName
					is nil, the notification center notifies the observer of all notifications with
					an object matching anObject. If anObject is nil, the notification center
					notifies the observer of all notifications with the name notificationName.
					
					The notification center does not retain anObserver or anObject. Therefore, you
					should always send <b>removeObserver:name:object:</b> to the notification center 
					before releasing these objects.
	@param			observer	The observer to send notifications to.
	@param			aSelector	The selector to call
	@param			notificationName	The notification to listen for

					method before deallocating the observer object or any object specified in 
					<b>addObserver:selector:name:object:</b>.
