	@abstract		Perform and monitor the burning of a CD or DVD disc.
	@discussion		Each time you want to burn to a disc, an instance of @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/DRBurn DRBurn @/link needs to be created. 
					
					When an instance is created, you pass in an instance of @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/DRDevice DRDevice @/link to let the DRBurn object know 
					what device to use. This object is retained for the life of the DRBurn instance. Before burning, 
					you can set several options that control the behavior of the burn and the handling 
					of the disc once the burn completes.
					
					A DRBurn object will send out notifications through the @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/DRNotificationCenter DRNotificationCenter @/link mechanism to 
					broadcast the burn state to any interested observers. However, if for some reason you don't want
					to use notifications, you can poll the burn object at any time for the current status using
					@link //apple_ref/occ/instm/DRBurn/status status @/link. This is not recommended in any 
					application using a run loop, because it involves polling.

					Here's an example that shows you how to use this class:
					
					<code>
					- (void) doBurn
					{
						DRDevice*       device;
						DRTrack*        track;
						DRBurn*         burn;
					
						<i>...determine correct device to burn to...</i>
						
						<i>...create track...</i>
						
						burn = [[DRBurn alloc] initWithDevice:device];
							
						<i>...set options appropriate to this burn...</i>
						
						// register to receive notification about the burn status.
						[[DRNotificationCenter currentRunLoopCenter] addObserver:self 
																		selector:&#x40;selector(burnNotification:) 
																			name:DRBurnStatusChangedNotification 
																		  object:burn];
						// start the burn
						[burn writeLayout:track];
					}
					
					- (void) burnNotification:(NSNotification*)notification
					{
						DRBurn*         burn = [notification object];
						NSDictionary*   status = [notification userInfo];
						
						<i>...do what you wish with the notification...</i>
