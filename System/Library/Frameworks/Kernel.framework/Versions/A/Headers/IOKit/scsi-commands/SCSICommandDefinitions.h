#pragma mark About this file
/* This file contains all the definitions for types and constants that are
 * used by the command set classes for building CDBs.  The field type
 * definitions are used for the parameters passed to a method that builds and
 * sends any SCSI defined command to clearly identify the type of value
 * expected for a parameter.
 * The command methods will then use the appropriate mask to verify that the
 * value passed into a parameter is of the specified type.
 * Currently only types and masks are defined for 4 bytes and smaller fields.
 * If a command is defined that uses a larger field, these should be expanded
 * to include those sizes.
