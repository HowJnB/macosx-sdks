/*-
 * AE Mach API --
 *
 * AppleEvents on OS X are implemented in terms of mach messages.
 * To facilitate writing server processes that can send and receive
 * AppleEvents, the following APIs are provided.
 *
 * AppleEvents are directed to a well known port uniquely tied to a
 * process.  The AE framework will discover this port based on the
 * keyAddressAttr of the event (as specifed in AECreateAppleEvent by
 * the target parameter.)  If a port cannot be found,
 * procNotFound (-600) will be returned on AESend.
 *
 * Of note is a new attribute for an AppleEvent, keyReplyPortAttr.
 * This specifies the mach_port_t to which an AppleEvent reply
 * should be directed.  By default, replies are sent to the
 * processes registered port where they are culled from the normal  
 * event stream if there is an outstanding AESend + kAEWaitReply.
 * But it may be desirable for a client to specify their own port to
 * receive quued replies.
 * (In the case of AESendMessage with kAEWaitReply specified, an 
 * anonymous port will be used to block until the reply is received.)
 *
 * Not supplied is a convenience routine to block a server and
 * process AppleEvents.  This implementation will be detailed in a
 * tech note.

 * will be used by other applications to target your process.  You

 * only if, you are not also using routines from HIToolbox.  In that
 * case, HIToolbox retains control of this port and AppleEvents are
 * dispatched through the main event loop.
