 *  LSOpenFSRef()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Open an application, document, or folder.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Opens applications, documents, and folders. Applications are
 *    opened via an 'oapp' or 'rapp' event. Documents are opened in
 *    their user-overridden or default applications as appropriate.
 *    Folders are opened in the Finder. Use the more specific
 *    LSOpenFromRefSpec for more control over launching.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.2
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inRef:
 *      The FSRef of the item to launch.
 *    
 *    outLaunchedRef:
 *      The FSRef of the item actually launched. For inRefs that are
 *      documents, outLaunchedRef will be the application used to
 *      launch the document. Can be NULL.
 *  
 *  Availability:
 *    Mac OS X:         in version 10.0 and later in ApplicationServices.framework
 *    CarbonLib:        not available in CarbonLib 1.x
 *    Non-Carbon CFM:   not available
