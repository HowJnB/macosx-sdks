 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Alter a print session and print settings so that an associated
 *    print job is sent to the provided destination type in the,
 *    optional, MIME document format.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function is most useful when an application would like to
 *    write its print output to disk without requiring user
 *    interaction. The list of MIME types that can be sent to the
 *    provided destination can be obtained from
 *    PMSessionCopyOutputFormatList and one of these passed to this
 *    function.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    printSession:
 *      The session to be used for a print job. The session holds the
 *      preview setting which can override the destination type in the
 *      print settings.
 *    
 *    printSettings:
 *      The print settings to be used for a print job. The print
 *      settings specify whether a job will be directed toward a
 *      printer or to file. It also holds the requested MIME output
 *      type.
 *    
 *    destType:
 *      The destiation type for a print job associated with the
 *      provided print session and print settings. Fax is currently not
 *      supported, but kPMDestinationPrinter, kPMDestinationFile, and
 *      kPMDestinationPreview can be set.
 *    
 *    destFormat:
 *      The MIME type to be generated for the provided destination
 *      type. This parameter can be NULL in which the default format
 *      for the requested destination type is used. To obtain a list of
 *      valid formats for a given destiation type, use the function
 *      PMSessionCopyOutputFormatList.
 *    
 *    destLocation:
 *      Some destination types support a destination location. The
 *      clearest example is the kPMDestinationFile destination type
 *      which allows a caller to also supply a file URL specifying
 *      where the output file is to be created.
 *

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Currently there are four destination types:
 *    kPMDestinationPrinter, kPMDestinationFile, kPMDestinationFax and
 *    kPMDestinationPreview. The first three destination types are
 *    stored in the print settings. The switch for preview is stored in
 *    the print session and, if enabled, overrides the destination in
 *    the print setting. This function is preferred over
 *    PMGetDestination as the latter does not take a print session
 *    parameter and therefore can not indicate whether preview has been
 *    selected as the destination.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    printSession:
 *      The session to be used for a print job. The session holds the
 *      preview setting which can override the destination type in the
 *      print settings.
 *    
 *    printSettings:
 *      The print settings to be used for a print job. The print
 *      settings specify whether a job will be directed toward a
 *      printer or to file.
 *    
 *    destTypeP:
 *      A pointer to a caller supplied PMDestinationType variable. If
 *      this function succeeds then *'destTypeP' will be filled in with
 *      the destination type for a print job that used the specified

 *  PMCGImageCreateWithEPSDataProvider()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Create an image reference that references both the PostScript
 *    contents of an EPS file and a preview (proxy) image for that EPS
 *    file.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    For OS X 10.1.0, this function ignores the passed in data
 *    provider. The passed in image reference is retained and then
 *    returned. For 10.1.1 and later, then the data provider is used
 *    and the returned image reference is different than the passed in
 *    image reference, so please be careful with your use of these
 *    references. It is likely that the data will not be read from the
 *    EPS data provider until well after this function returns. The
 *    caller should be careful not to free the underlying EPS data
 *    until the provider's release routine is invoked. Similarly the
 *    preview image's data may be needed long after you think it should
 *    be. Do not free the image data until the image data provider's
 *    release data function has been called. To make sure these data
 *    providers are properly reference counted, release your reference
 *    the EPS data provider and on the EPS image preview when they are
 *    no longer needed by your application. For Mac OS X 10.2 and
 *    later, the contents of the EPS provider at the time of this call
 *    can be dumped to a file if you first do the following, BEFORE
 *    running your application. From the command line in terminal:
 *    defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.print.eps.testProvider
 *    /tmp/dump.eps causes a dump of the EPS data into a file
 *    /tmp/dump.eps.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    epsDataProvider:
 *      A Core Graphics data provider that can supply the PostScript
 *      contents of the EPS file. Post OS X 10.1, there will be some
 *      checking done on the EPS data provided to the
 *      PMCGImageCreateWithEPSDataProvider() call. It is important that
 *      the EPS data begin with the EPSF required header and bounding
 *      box DSC comments.
 *    
 *    epsPreview:
 *      A Core Graphics image reference to the proxy image for the EPS
 *      file. When the image reference result of this function is
 *      rendered on screen or printed to a printer that can not render
 *      PostScript this proxy image is drawn instead.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    an image reference capable of rendering either the EPS content or
 *    the proxy image depending upon the capabilities of the targeted
 *    context.

 *  PMPrinterPrintWithFile()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Submit a file for printing to a specified printer.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    One reason this function may fail is if the specified printer can
 *    not handle the file's mime type. Use PMPrinterGetMimeTypes() to
 *    check whether a mime type is supported. This function is
 *    implemented using PMPrinterPrintWithProvider().
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    printer:
 *      The printer.
 *    
 *    settings:
 *      The print settings for the print job.
 *    
 *    format:
 *      The physical page size and orientation on to which the document
 *      should be printed. This parameter can be NULL.
 *    
 *    mimeType:
 *      The mime type of the file to be printed. If this parameter is
 *      NULL then the supplied file will be auto-typed.
 *    
 *    fileURL:
 *      A file URL specifying the file to be printed.
 *  
 *  Availability:
