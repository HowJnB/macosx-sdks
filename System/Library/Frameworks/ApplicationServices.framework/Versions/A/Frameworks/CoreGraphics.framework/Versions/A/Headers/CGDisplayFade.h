 * a time interval to perform the fade operation in seconds,
 * a starting and ending blend coefficient, an RGB color in device space,
 * and a boolean to indicate that the operation should be done synchronously.
 *
 * Over the fade operation time interval, the system will interpolate a
 * blending coefficient between the starting and ending values given,
 * applying a nonlinear (sine-based) bias term, and will blend the video output
 * with the specified color based on the resulting value.
 *
 * If the time interval is specifed as 0.0, then the ending state blend value is
 * applied at once and the function returns.
 *
 * The maximum allowable time interval is 15 seconds.
 *
 * If the parameter 'synchronous' is true, the function does not return
 * til the fade operation is complete.  If false, the function returns at once,
 * and the fade operation runs asynchronously.
 *
 * CGReleaseDisplayFadeReservation may be safely called while an async fade
 * operation is running, and if the ending blend value is kCGDisplayBlendNormal,
 * will not disturb the running operation.  The reservation is dropped when the
 * fade opertion completes.
