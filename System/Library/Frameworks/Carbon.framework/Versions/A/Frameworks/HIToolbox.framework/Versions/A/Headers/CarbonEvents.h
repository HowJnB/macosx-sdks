   *** NOTE ON AUTOMATIC TYPE CONVERSIONS
   Please keep in mind that some of these types can be automatically converted
   to other types just by asking for them as different types. The following
   type conversions are automatic:
        typeQDRectangle     <-->        typeHIRect
        typeQDPoint         <-->        typeHIPoint
   In addition, if a CFBoolean type is added to an event, a request to receive
   the data as typeBoolean (instead of typeCFType), will be automatically honored.

 *  Discussion:

 *    calls such as StillDown and WaitMouseUp. The advantage over those
 *    routines is that TrackMouseLocation and TrackMouseRegion will
 *    block if the user is not moving the mouse, whereas mouse tracking
 *    loops based on StillDown and WaitMouseUp will spin, chewing up
 *    valuable CPU time that could be better spent elsewhere. It is
 *    highly recommended that any tracking loops in your application

/*
 *  TrackMouseLocation()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Once entered, this routine waits for certain mouse events (move,
 *    mouse down, mouse up). When one of these events occurs, the
 *    function returns and tells the caller what happened and where the
 *    mouse is currently located. While there is no activity, the
 *    current event loop is run, effectively blocking the current
 *    thread (save for any timers that fire). This helps to minimize
 *    CPU usage when there is nothing going on. 
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier, and CarbonLib 1.5 and earlier,
 *    TrackMouseLocation, TrackMouseLocationWithOptions, and
 *    TrackMouseRegion only support mouse-tracking when a mouse button
 *    is pressed. They cannot be used for mouse-tracking when no mouse
 *    button is pressed; if called when no button is pressed, they will
 *    simply block until a button is pressed and will not return when
 *    the mouse is moved. On Mac OS X 10.2 and CarbonLib 1.6 and later,
 *    TrackMouseLocation, TrackMouseLocationWithOptions, and
 *    TrackMouseRegion support mouse-tracking without a pressed mouse
 *    button; TrackMouseLocation and TrackMouseLocationWithOptions
 *    return kMouseTrackingMouseMoved if the mouse is moved while no
 *    button is pressed, and TrackMouseRegion returns
 *    kMouseTrackingMouseEntered/Exited if the mouse moves into or out
 *    of the specified region while no button is pressed.

 *      port. You can pass -1 for this parameter to indicate that the
 *      mouse location should be returned in global coordinates instead
 *      of local coordinates.
 *    
 *    outPt:
 *      On exit, this parameter receives the mouse location from the
 *      last mouse event that caused this function to exit.
 *    
 *    outResult:
 *      On exit, this parameter receives a value representing what kind

 *    
 *    inTimeout:
 *      The amount of time to wait for an event. If no events arrive
 *      within this time, kMouseTrackingTimedOut is returned in

 *    
 *    outPt:

/*

    ** Document Access Text events **

    The following Text Access events are very similar in design to the CFString API.
    The entire document can be conceived as a flattened Unicode string, and the
    events in this interface can access any portion of it.  The GetSelectedRange() method
    allow a text service to obtain text near the insertion point (or selection), but access
    is by no means restricted to this vicinity.  Use the GetLength() method to obtain the
    size of the document.
    
    Supporting these events effectively provide hooks into the text engine, but it is
    understood that access to a document in this way is to be strictly Read-Only.  Where
    direct access to a document's content cannot be provided through a pointer, the requested
    text can be copied instead.  Situations where a pointer may not be available from the
    text engine include the following:
    
        -A pointer would require conversion of text in Mac encodings to Unicode
        -A pointer would require sparse Unicode text blocks to be flattened into a single
         buffer.

    The idea is to minimize copying and converting text encodings where possible.  The text
    service will typically begin by asking for a document pointer via
    kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtr.  If this fails, it will typically fallback to
    kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharactersPtrForLargestBuffer, specifying a location of interest.
    If this fails, it will fallback to kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharacters, specifying a range
    of interest.  Of course, when requesting small amounts of data such a few characters on either
    side of the insertion point, there is no obligation to optimize in this way.  It's valid to
    simply use kEventTSMDocumentAccessGetCharacters.
    
    The text engine is entirely free to deny a request for a text pointer for these or any other
    implementation specific reason.

/*
 *  kEventClassTSMDocumentAccess / kEventTSMDocumentAccessLockDocument
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Notifies the app that it should not change its document's text
 *    content (on its own) while a text service is involved in a
 *    transaction.  The app should not allow changes, for example, by
 *    its secondary threads.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    These events define how a text service can obtain access to a
 *    document in a way that ensures data integrity during its
 *    transaction.  The primary motivation of these events is to
 *    prevent the application from letting its secondary threads modify
 *    the document while a text service is busy servicing an event,
 *    such as a key event, or some user interaction with text service
 *    provided UI such as a menu selection. Also, while the document is
 *    locked, a text service is free to request pointer access to the
 *    document's text content (if this is supported by the app's text
 *    engine.) These lock-related events should be implemented using a
 *    ref counting scheme. Most apps will not support this kind of
 *    threading, so implementation of these events in the text engine
 *    will be optional.   In most text engines, the implementation of
 *    these events should be trivial, i.e. just maintain a simple
 *    semaphore.  TSM itself will implicitly lock/unlock around normal
 *    entry points into a text service, such as when it delivers key
 *    events to an input method, but there may be times when document
 *    changes can be driven by an input method without TSM involvement,
 *    such as the Carbon events involved when the user interacts with
 *    some UI.  In this case, the input method must manage locking, if
 *    the app supports it.  However, the logic in an input method
 *    should not have to care whether TSM is in the call chain or
 *    not... and TSM should not have to care whether an input method
 *    will do the right thing. This is why the lock mechanism needs to
 *    be some kind of refcounting scheme instead of a simple on/off
 *    mechanism. This document lock support is completely optional on
 *    the part of the text engine (if it is not threaded).  TSM will
 *    implicitly lock/unlock the document around delivery of events to

 *          be replaced by a new subrange of text, identified by the
 *          second TextRange in the pair.  The new text subrange is
 *          obtained from the contents of the
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter.  In general, the
 *          Nth array element, where N is even, specifies the range of
 *          old text to be updated and array element N+1 specifies the
 *          range of new text to replace the corresponding old text. 
 *          The fHiliteStyle field of the TextRange records is ignored
 *          in this parameter. NOTE:  There are some "loose ends" in
 *          the TSM event protocol that were never clearly defined, but
 *          which have been introduced over the years by input methods
 *          themselves, probably through some trial and error.  The
 *          conventions regarding this optional parameter seem to be as
 *          follows: If the UpdateRng parameter is missing from the
 *          event, the input method is requesting that the entire
 *          contents of the existing inline input session (if there is
 *          one) is to be replaced "wholesale" by the new text
 *          contained in the kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter. If
 *          the UpdateRng parameter exists, but contains no ranges
 *          (i.e. fNumOfRanges == 0), this seems to be hint from the
 *          input method that no text in the active input area is
 *          changing.  It may be that the existing active input area is
 *          being confirmed "as is", or that the input method is
 *          modifying its highlite attributes in some way, due to some
 *          user action, such as changing the selected clause or
 *          highlited subrange of text in the active input area, or
 *          that the input method is changing the caret position in the
 *          active input area (if it uses the kCaretPosition hilite
 *          style). Depending on how your text engine draws hilite
 *          styles supported in the kEventParamTextInputSendHiliteRng
 *          parameter, you may or may not need to redraw the text
 *          itself, simply change the hilite. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be present in all instances of this
 *          event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendHiliteRng (in, typeTextRangeArray)
 *          An array of text-range records (see TextRangeArray) that
 *          specifies how various subranges of the active input area
 *          are to be highlited, and possibly specifies caret position
 *          within the active input area. NOTE:  The text offsets used
 *          in the HiliteRng parameter are relative to the beginning of
 *          the active input area AFTER all text has been updated (per
 *          the SendUpdateRng parameter) and any (subrange of) text has
 *          been confirmed.  Specifically, if the entire text is being
 *          confirmed, it is clear that any contents of this parameter
 *          should be ignored, especially non-zero values
 *          kCaretPosition. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendClauseRng (in, typeOffsetArray)
 *          An array of offsets (see OffsetArray) used by an input
 *          method to specify word or clause boundaries in the
 *          resulting active input area.  Offsets are relative to the
 *          start of the resulting active input area. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be present in all instances of this
 *          event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendPinRng (in, typeTextRange)
 *          A TextRange record that specifies a start offset and an end
 *          offset that should be scrolled into view if the text
 *          specified by these offsets is not already in view. The
 *          fHiliteStyle field of the TextRange records is ignored in
 *          this parameter. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextServiceEncoding (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The encoding associated with the text sent by an input
 *          method. On MacOS X, this parameter is not commonly used
 *          because all TSM input methods produce Unicode, but TSM will
 *          respect a Unicode encoding variant here, if specified. In
 *          CarbonLib, this parameter identifies the Mac encoding
 *          (usually an encoding variant) of the text produced by the
 *          input method on MacOS, where it is not a requirement that
 *          input methods be Unicode-savvy.  On this platform, TSM
 *          needs the information to convert text to Unicode from a Mac
 *          encoding variant which cannot be derived from the
 *          ScriptLanguage record associated with the input method
 *          component. This parameter is optional and may not be
 *          present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextServiceMacEncoding (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The Mac encoding (variant) associated with the text sent by
 *          an input method. On Mac OS X, this parameter is needed by
 *          TSM to convert input method produced Unicodes to a Mac
 *          encoding when the application that has focus is not
 *          Unicode-savvy in the TSM sense... i.e. the current
 *          TSMDocument is not of type kUnicodeDocument. This parameter
 *          can also be useful if a Unicode-savvy handler should need
 *          to convert from Unicode. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray (in, typeGlyphInfoArray)
 *          A TSMGlyphInfoArray structure in which an input method can
 *          associate unencoded glyphs IDs and/or fonts with
 *          (sub)ranges of text it produces.  The array elements
 *          identify non-overlapping ranges of text and the glyph ID
 *          (character collection is 0) such as in an OpenType font, or
 *          the CID (collection is non-zero) such as in TrueType fonts.
 *           If the glyphID itself is 0, only the font specified is to
 *          be applied to the text range.  This is useful for
 *          characters in Unicode private use area, such as Windings,
 *          but note that this capability should be used with care
 *          because changing the font of an input text stream can lead
 *          to a confusing user interface. An input method will only
 *          include this parameter if the text engine has indicated it
 *          supports this feature via the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportGlyphInfoPropertyTag TSMDocumentProperty
 *          tag. For more information, see the Glyph Access protocol
 *          described in TechNote TN20TT. This parameter is optional
 *          and may not be present in all instances of this event.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendReplaceRange (in, typeCFRange)
 *          The CFRange in the application's document that should be
 *          replaced by the contents of the inline input session
 *          defined by other parameters in this event.  The text
 *          service will have obtained and calculated this range by
 *          accessing the document's text via events of the
 *          TSMDocumentAccess class.  This CFRange parameter refers to
 *          text in flat Unicode space (UniChar) offsets, and its
 *          location is document relative, not relative to the
 *          insertion point or any inline session. A text service may
 *          include this parameter only if the text engine has
 *          indicated it supports this feature via the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportDocumentAccessPropertyTag
 *          TSMDocumentProperty tag. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be present in all instances of this event. NOTE:  This
 *          parameter is supported by the TSM Carbon event only, not by
 *          TSM's kUpdateActiveInputArea AppleEvent.  If a text engine
 *          developer wishes to support this parameter, it must
 *          implement a Carbon event handler for this event and set the
 *          kTSMDocumentSupportDocumentAccessPropertyTag property tag.
 *          NOTE:  Care must be exercised by the app when there is an
 *          active inline input session. A text service that sends an a
 *          UpdateActiveInputArea event specifying this parameter
 *          should not be the same text service that owns the inline
 *          input session, since the text engine would need to call
 *          FixTSMDocument().  This, in turn, would cause recursion
 *          through that same text service via FixTextService().
 *          However, the app should be prepared for recursion
 *          regardless of which text service owns the inline input
 *          session because it will call FixTSMDocument() to confirm
 *          the inline input session, and "somebody" will likely send
 *          an UpdateActiveInputArea event as a result. Therefore,
 *          document state obtained before the call to FixTSMDocument()
 *          may not be valid after this call completes.
 *

/*
 *  kEventClassTextInput / kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Provides Unicode text input resulting from either a key event
 *    (TSM originates the event in this case) or from a
 *    kEventTextInputUnicodeText event produced by an input method,
 *    such as a Character Palette class input method, or a HandWriting
 *    input method.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This is the primary event by which applications should receive
 *    text input on Mac OS X. Apple recommends that applications use
 *    this event rather than the kEventRawKeyDown event to handle text
 *    input. 
 *    
 *    A client need not be fully TSM-aware to process or receive this
 *    event. You can also get Mac encoding characters from the raw
 *    keyboard event contained in this event. If no UnicodeForKeyEvent
 *    handler is installed, and no kUnicodeNotFromInputMethod
 *    AppleEvent handler is installed (or the application has not
 *    created a Unicode TSMDocument), the Mac encoding charCodes (if
 *    these can be converted from the Unicodes) are provided to
 *    WaitNextEvent. 
 *    
 *    This event is generated automatically by TSM when a
 *    kEventRawKeyDown event is sent to the application event target.
 *    The typical keyboard event flow begins with a kEventRawKeyDown
 *    event posted to the event queue. This event is dequeued during
 *    WaitNextEvent or RunApplicationEventLoop, and sent to the event
 *    dispatcher target. If the keydown event reaches the application
 *    target, it is handled by TSM, which generates a
 *    kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent and sends it to the event
 *    dispatcher target. The event dispatcher will resend the event to
 *    the user focus target, which sends it to the focused control in
 *    the focused window.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendComponentInstance (in, typeComponentInstance)
 *          This parameter is provided by the input method originating
 *          the event. (Required parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendRefCon (in, typeLongInteger)
 *          TSM's SendTextInputEvent, called by an input method,
 *          inserts this parameter before dispatching the event to the
 *          user focus.  (Required Parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendSLRec (in, typeIntlWritingCode)
 *          The ScriptLanguageRecord associated with the text contained
 *          in the event. This parameter is normally provided by the
 *          input method originating the event.  TSM's
 *          SendTextInputEvent will construct this parameter from
 *          current script information as a result of a key event, or
 *          using input method provided information when TSM receives a
 *          kEventTextInputUnicodeText event.  (Required Parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendText (in, typeUnicodeText)
 *          The Unicode characters that were entered by the user.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendKeyboardEvent (in, typeEventRef)
 *          This parameter is the original raw keyboard event that
 *          produced the text. It enables access to
 *          kEventParamKeyModifiers and kEventParamKeyCode parameters.
 *          Note that when contents of TSMÕs bottom-line input window
 *          are confirmed (i.e., during typing of Chinese, Korean, or
 *          Japanese), the raw keyboard eventÕs keyCode and modifiers
 *          are set to default values. 
 *          
 *          You can also extract from the RawKeyDown event either
 *          Unicodes or Mac encoding characters as follows:
 *          
 *          kEventParamKeyUnicodes      typeUnicodeText
 *           kEventParamKeyMacCharCodes  typeChar (if available)
 *           
 *          The kEventParamKeyUnicodes parameter of the raw keyboard
 *          event is identical to the TextInput eventÕs
 *          kEventParamTextInputSendText parameter.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendGlyphInfoArray (in, typeGlyphInfoArray)
 *          A TSMGlyphInfoArray structure in which an input method can
 *          associate unencoded glyphs IDs and/or fonts with
 *          (sub)ranges of text it produces.  The array elements
 *          identify non-overlapping ranges of text and the glyph ID
 *          (character collection is 0) such as in an OpenType font, or
 *          the CID (collection is non-zero) such as in TrueType fonts.
 *           If the glyphID itself is 0, only the font specified is to
 *          be applied to the text range.  This is useful for
 *          characters in Unicode private use area, such as Windings,
 *          but note that this capability should be used with care

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is typically produced by an input method so that it

 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendRefCon (in, typeLongInteger)
 *          TSM's SendTextInputEvent, called by an input method,

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendTextOffset (in, typeLongInteger)
 *          The text offset in an active input area for which the
 *          global position (in QD coordinates) is desired.  (Required
 *          Parameter) NOTE:  If no input area is active, the original
 *          definition of this parameter IM-Text 7-74 states that the
 *          offset is "relative to the start of the current text body".
 *           However, some applications have implemented the case
 *          offset = 0 relative to the insertion point, which makes
 *          some sense in that an input method is typically interested
 *          in interacting with the user at the insertion point and
 *          this allows an input method to display some UI (such as a
 *          translucent input mode indicator)  near the insertion point
 *          even before typing has taken place.  Input Methods usually
 *          have no reason to care about the on-screen position of the
 *          beginning of a text document.
 *          
 *          However, new events in the TSM suite now allow an input
 *          method to obtain the insertion point as a document-relative
 *          offset in Unicode space, so the original definition of this
 *          parameter should hold... the text offset is to be
 *          considered relative to the beginning of the text document,
 *          especially when the app indicates it supports the TSM text
 *          Attribute events, specifically
 *          kEventTextInputGetInsertionPointAttributes.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendSLRec (in, typeIntlWritingCode)
 *          Specifies which glyph on either side of the supplied text
 *          offset that should be used to compute the on-screen
 *          position returned.  This value is similar to the
 *          leadingEdge parameter of the QuickDraw PixelToChar
 *          function.  If this parameter is true, the location of the
 *          character (or characters if the glyph is represented by
 *          multiple characters) at the specified text offset is
 *          returned.  If this parameter is false, the on-screen
 *          position returned should be the trailing edge of the glyph
 *          represented by the character (or characters) immediately
 *          preceding (in memory order) the supplied text offset. Note
 *          also that while the on-screen position for a given offset
 *          and leading/trailing edge value is affected by this
 *          parameter, it also affects what should be returned for the
 *          other optional parameters at style run boundaries, such as

 *          may not be present in all instances of this event. The
 *          default value for this parameter is 'true'.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendLeadingEdge (in, typeBoolean)
 *          The position on screen (in QD coordinates) of the requested

 *          reply parameter)
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyPoint (out, typeQDPoint)

 *          parameter is optional and may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplySLRec (out, typeIntlWritingCode)
 *          The QD Font associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the QD Font of the active
 *          input area if one exists, or of the text at the specified
 *          offset and specified leading/ trailing edge value.  At a
 *          font run boundary, such as where a Japanese text run ends,
 *          and a Roman begins, a leading edge value of 'true' should
 *          return the font of the Roman text run while a leading edge
 *          value of 'false' should return the Japanese font. This
 *          parameter is optional and may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyFont (out, typeLongInteger)
 *          The FMFont associated with the text at the offset specified
 *          in the event, either the FMFont of the active input area if
 *          one exists, or of the text at the specified offset and
 *          specified leading/ trailing edge value.  At a font run
 *          boundary, such as where a Japanese text run ends, and a
 *          Roman begins, a leading edge value of 'true' should return
 *          the font of the Roman text run while a leading edge value
 *          of 'false' should return the Japanese font. This parameter
 *          allows the handler to return an FMFont when a FMFontFamily
 *          or FOND would be inconvenient to compute. This parameter is
 *          optional and may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyFMFont (out, typeUInt32)
 *          The point size associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the point size of the active

 *          offset.  At a style run boundary where point size changes,
 *          the leadingEdge parameter determines which point size
 *          should be returned. This parameter is optional and may not
 *          be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyPointSize (out, typeFixed)
 *          The line height associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the line height of the
 *          active input area if one exists, or of the text at the
 *          specified offset.  At a style run boundary where point size
 *          changes, the leadingEdge parameter determines which line
 *          height should be returned. This parameter is optional and
 *          may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyLineHeight (out, typeShortInteger)
 *          The line ascent associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the line ascent of the
 *          active input area if one exists, or of the text at the
 *          specified offset.  At a style run boundary where point size
 *          changes, the leadingEdge parameter determines which line
 *          ascent should be returned. This parameter is optional and
 *          may not be returned to the caller.
 *    
 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyLineAscent (out, typeShortInteger)
 *          The orientation associated with the text at the offset
 *          specified in the event, either the orientation of the
 *          active input area if one exists, or of the text at the
 *          specified offset.  At a style run boundary where
 *          orientation changes, the leadingEdge parameter determines
 *          which orientation should be returned.  The value 90
 *          specifies a horizontal line direction and 180 specifies a
 *          vertical line direction. This parameter is optional and may
 *          not be returned to the caller.

 *          (Required Parameter)
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTextInputSendDraggingMode (in, typeBoolean)
 *          A Boolean value that indicates whether the input method is

 *    <-- kEventParamTextInputReplyRegionClass (out, typeLongInteger)
 *          The text offset corresponding to the supplied QD point. If

    @discussion     This is the lowest-level keyboard input event. When this event is sent, the keyboard
                    input has not yet been processed by the Text Services Manager or passed to input methods.
                    Usually, you should not handle this event, because doing so may interfere with input
                    methods; instead, you should handle the kEventTextInputUnicodeForKeyEvent event, which
                    is sent after input methods have handled the raw key event, and contains both Unicode
                    and the original keyboard event.
                    
                    This event has a default handler on the application event target. The default handler
                    calls the Text Services Manager to pass the event through to input methods. The default
                    handler also implements certain standard keyboard equivalents, such as cmd-` for intra-
                    process window rotation and the universal keyboard access equivalents for interprocess
                    window rotation and document, floating, toolbar, and menubar keyboard focus.

 *    
 *    This event is currently sent in two circumstances: when the Dock

 *    has changed. A separate copy of this event is sent to each
 *    affected GDevice.
 *    
 *    All applications have a default handler installed on the
 *    application target that responds to this event by sending
 *    kEventWindowConstrain events to each window on the specified
 *    device. It is not possible to prevent this handler from running,
 *    since this event is sent to all registered handlers. However,
 *    applications that would like to do their own window layout may
 *    install a handler for this event, and also set the
 *    kWindowNoConstrainAttribute on their windows, which will cause
 *    the basic window handler to ignore kEventWindowConstrain. An
 *    application may also install its own kEventWindowConstrain
 *    handler and selectively return a value other than
 *    eventNotHandledErr, which will prevent the event from being sent
 *    to the basic window handler.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *    --> kEventParamTransactionID (in, typeUInt32)
 *          An integer which is the same for all instances of this

 *          For example, if multiple displays are attached, then this
 *          event is sent once for each display after a display
 *          configuration change; however, the transaction ID parameter
 *          will the same for each event, so a handler for this event

 *    If you need to handle this Carbon event yourself, the necessary

    On window handlers:
    
    All windows have a handler installed called the Òbasic window handler.Ó This handler provides certain
    basic services for all windows; for example, it handles clicks in the collapse and toolbar buttons,
    since these buttons were handled automatically for WaitNextEvent-based applications in the classic
    Mac OS toolbox, and so are still be handled automatically in Carbon by the basic window handler. The
    basic window handler also implements the HICommands that are sent by the standard window menu to minimize,
    maximize, or zoom a window (kHICommandMinimize/Maximize/ZoomWindow), and the window-class events that are
    generated by those commands (kEventWindowCollapse/Expand/Zoom).
    
    When the window is created with, or has added, the kWindowStandardHandlerAttribute, the window also has
    installed the Òstandard window handler.Ó The standard handler provides much more advanced behavior than
    the basic window handler; a window using the standard handler generally requires no other extra handlers
    to move, resize, redraw, or track user clicks in controls. Applications will generally add extra handlers
    to respond to command events generated by controls in the window.

 *    Sent during DragWindow or ResizeWindow, before the window is

 *    bounds-changing APIs such as SetWindowBounds and ZoomWindow. An
 *    event handler may alter the kEventParamCurrentBounds parameter in

 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.1 and later, kEventWindowBoundsChanging is sent

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The basic window handler responds to this event by calling
 *    ConstrainWindowToScreen. This event is generated in two
 *    situations: changes in graphics device configuration, and changes
 *    to Dock size. In either case, a window which was previously

 *    positioning bounds. 
 *    
 *    The behavior of the basic window handler may be customized by
 *    modifying the parameters to the event and then allowing the event
 *    to pass through to the basic handler, or an application may
 *    choose to override the event entirely and perform its own window
 *    constraining. 
 *    
 *    Applications may also use the
 *    kEventAppAvailableWindowBoundsChanged event to be notified of

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamAvailableBounds (in, typeQDRectangle)
 *          The reasons why the window is being constrained. This
 *          parameter contains one or more of the

 *          available only on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamAttributes (in, typeUInt32)
 *          An integer which is the same for all instances of this

 *          For example, if multiple displays are attached, then this

 *          after a display configuration change; however, the
 *          transaction ID parameter will the same for each event, so a

 *          the transaction ID. This parameter is available only on Mac
 *          OS X 10.3 and later.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamWindowRegionCode (in, typeWindowRegionCode)
 *          The available window positioning bounds in which the window

 *          in this parameter and then return eventNotHandledErr to
 *          allow the basic window handler to constrain the window to

 *          
 *          This parameter is used by the basic window handler on Mac
 *          OS X 10.1 and later; on earlier versions of Mac OS X, the

 *    --> kEventParamRgnHandle (in, typeQDRgnHandle)
 *          Window constraint options that should be passed to

 *          on Mac OS X 10.2 and later. 
 *          
 *          An event handler may compare this region with the current

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent from inside MenuKey, MenuEvent, and
 *    IsMenuKeyEvent before those APIs examine the menu for an item
 *    that matches a keyboard event. It is also sent during menu
 *    tracking before a menu is first made visible; it is sent
 *    immediately after kEventMenuOpening, once per menu per menu
 *    tracking session. It is also sent to the top-level menus in the
 *    menubar when the application is idle after user input has
 *    occurred, to allow the menu titles to be enabled or disabled
 *    appropriately according to the current user focus. You can
 *    distinquish between all these cases by examining the contents of
 *    the kEventParamMenuContext parameter. 
 *    
 *    If you install an event handler for kEventCommandProcess, you
 *    should also install a handler for either kEventMenuEnableItems or
 *    kEventCommandUpdateStatus. This is necessary because the Carbon
 *    event system will attempt to match command keys against the
 *    available menus before returning the keyboard event to your
 *    application via WaitNextEvent. If you have menu command event
 *    handlers installed for your menu items, your handlers will be
 *    called without your ever receiving the keyboard event or calling
 *    MenuKey/MenuEvent/IsMenuKeyEvent yourself. Therefore, you have no
 *    opportunity to enable your menu items properly other than from a
 *    kEventMenuEnableItems or kEventCommandUpdateStatus handler. 
 *     It is not necessary to handle this event if you do not install
 *    kEventCommandProcess handlers for your menu items; in that case,
 *    the command key event will be returned from WaitNextEvent or
 *    ReceiveNextEvent as normal, and you can set up your menus before

 *  kEventClassMenu / kEventMenuPopulate
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    kEventMenuPopulate is intended to be handled by applications that
 *    dynamically create their menu contents just-in-time before the
 *    menu is displayed. A handler for this event can add items to tbe
 *    menu that will be displayed or searched for a command key.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent to all handlers registered for it. Previously,
 *    kEventMenuOpening was recommended for the purpose of dynamically
 *    updating menu content. kEventMenuPopulate is now recommended
 *    because it will be sent by the Menu Manager before it searches a
 *    menu for a matching command key, to allow a handler to
 *    dynamically add menu items that may have command key equivalents
 *    to the menu; kEventMenuOpening is only sent before the menu is
 *    displayed. kEventMenuPopulate is also sent just before
 *    kEventMenuOpening as a menu is being displayed. Finally,
 *    kEventMenuPopulate is only sent once per menu tracking session
 *    for a given menu, even if that menu is closed and opened multiple
 *    times by the user; kEventMenuOpening is sent each time that the
 *    menu is displayed. 
 *    
 *    You can distinguish the command-key case from the
 *    menu-being-displayed case by examining the contents of the
 *    kEventParamMenuContext parameter; the kMenuContextKeyMatching
 *    flag will be set if the event is sent during command key
 *    matching, and either the kMenuContextMenuBarTracking or
 *    kMenuContextPopUpTracking flags will be sent if the event is sent
 *    before actual display of the menu. 
 *    
 *    In Mac OS X 10.2 and CarbonLib 1.6, kEventMenuPopulate is also
 *    sent to menus before the menu is searched for a command ID by the
 *    CountMenuItemsWithCommandID and GetIndMenuItemWithCommandID APIs.
 *    You can distinguish this case by checking for the
 *    kMenuContextCommandIDSearch flag in the kEventParamMenuContext
 *    parameter. In this case, the event also includes a
 *    kEventParamMenuCommand parameter with the command ID being
 *    searched for as the event parameter data.

 *    will cause this event to be sent; if the menu item does not have

 *    be zero, but the event will still contain a valid MenuRef and
 *    MenuItemIndex. Controls will send this event only if the control
 *    has a non-zero command ID set with SetControlCommandID. 
 *    
 *    Some senders of this event will also include the modifier keys
 *    that were pressed by the user when the command was invoked, but
 *    this parameter is optional and may not be present in all
 *    instances of this event. 
 *    
 *    When a command event is sent from a menu, a MenuContext parameter

 *    (kMenuContextMenuBar will not be set). The MenuContext parameter
 *    also indicates whether the event was sent by a selection of a
 *    menu item with the mouse (kMenuContextMenuBarTracking or
 *    kMenuContextPopUpTracking will be set), or by a command key press
 *    (kMenuContextKeyMatching will be set). If you need to determine

 *    popup or bevel button controls; if, for example, you return noErr
 *    for command events sent in response to a menu selection from a
 *    popup button, the Menu Manager will return zero from
 *    PopUpMenuSelect, and the popup button control will not know that
 *    an item was selected from the popup menu and will not redraw with
 *    the new selection.

/*
 *  kEventClassCommand / kEventCommandUpdateStatus
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    A command-generating user interface element requires updating.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    When you receive this event, you should update the necessary UI
 *    elements in your application to reflect the current status of the
 *    command. For example, if the command has the kHICommandFromMenu
 *    bit set, you should update the menu item state, menu item text,
 *    and so on, to reflect the current reality in your application. If
 *    the menu item is the "Undo" item, and the last editing change to
 *    the document was a Cut operation, then you might set the text to
 *    "Undo Cut" and enable the menu item. 
 *    
 *    Currently, this event is only sent for menu items; it is not used
 *    to update the status of controls. 
 *    
 *    Note that when responding to this event, you should only update
 *    the status of the single user interface element (a menu item, for
 *    example) described by the HICommand structure; you should not
 *    update the status of the entire menu or of all menus in the
 *    menubar. You will receive a separate UpdateStatus event for each
 *    menu item in a menu, and each item should be updated
 *    individually. When updating a menu item, you should generally not
 *    use Enable/DisableMenuCommand; these APIs search the entire menu
 *    hierarchy for the command ID. Instead, just call
 *    Enable/DisableMenuItem directly, passing the menu and menu item
 *    index that are provided to you in the HICommand structure.
 *    
 *    
 *    You may wish to optimize your handling of the UpdateStatus event
 *    by examining the MenuContext parameter to the event. This
 *    parameter indicates the context in which the command requires
 *    updating. For example, if the menu context parameter has the
 *    kMenuContextKeyMatching bit set, you know that the update request
 *    is being sent in while search for a menu item that matches a
 *    command key. This knowledge can help you avoid unnecessary work;
 *    if your menu item for this command has no command key, for
 *    example, you can ignore this event when the KeyMatching bit is
 *    set because your menu item will never match a command key
 *    anyways, regardless of whether it is enabled or disabled.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamDirectObject (in, typeHICommand)

 *          If the command was contained in a menu, information about
 *          the menu and the context of the command updating request.
 *          This parameter is optional and may not be present in all
 *          instances of this event.

/*
 *  kEventClassControl / kEventControlClick
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    A mouse down event occurred over a control.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent when a non-contextual-menu click occurs over a
 *    control; a contextual menu click generates
 *    kEventControlContextualMenuClick instead.
 *    
 *    The handler of this event is responsible for two things: first,
 *    the handler must set the keyboard focus to the control if the
 *    control takes focus on clicks; look for the
 *    kControlGetsFocusOnClick feature bit and call an API such as
 *    SetKeyboardFocus. Second, the handler must call one of the
 *    control tracking APIs: HIViewClick, HandleControlClick, or
 *    TrackControl. The standard window handler does both of these
 *    things.
 *    
 *    Warning: Beware of handling kEventControlClick events! This is
 *    usually NOT the event you really want to handle.
 *    kEventControlClick is a request to "please click this control,"
 *    not "allow a control definition to track the mouse." If you are
 *    implementing or overriding a control definitionÕs or HIViewÕs
 *    support for tracking the mouse, you should handle
 *    kEventControlTrack instead.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamDirectObject (in, typeControlRef)
 *          The control that was clicked.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamMouseLocation (in, typeHIPoint)
 *          The mouse location, in global coordinates.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamWindowRef (in, typeWindowRef)
 *          The window under the mouse.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamWindowMouseLocation (in, typeHIPoint)
 *          The window-relative position of the mouse in the window
 *          given in the kEventParamWindowRef parameter. 0,0 is at the
 *          top left of the structure of the window.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamWindowPartCode (in, typeWindowPartCode)
 *          The part code the mouse location hit in the window. This
 *          parameter only exists if the windowRef parameter exists.
 *          This saves you the trouble of calling FindWindow, which is
 *          expensive on Mac OS X as it needs to call the Window

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamMouseButton (in, typeMouseButton)

 *    
 *    --> kEventParamMouseChord (in, typeUInt32)
 *          Which other mouse buttons were pressed when the event was
 *          generated. Available on Mac OS X only.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTabletEventType (in, typeUInt32)
 *          The type of tablet event which generated this mouse event;
 *          contains either kEventTabletPoint or kEventTabletProximity.
 *          Only present if the event was generated from a tablet.
 *    
 *    --> kEventParamTabletPointRec (in, typeTabletPointRec)
 *          Further information about the tablet event which generated
 *          this mouse event. Present if the the

 *  kEventClassControl / kEventControlHit
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sent by TrackControl and HandleControlClick after handling a
 *    click in a control.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event indicates that a control has been manipulated by the
 *    user and that the user released the mouse button over some part
 *    of the control. It is sent automatically by the Control Manager
 *    when the control tracking code returns a non-zero part
 *    code.
 *    
 *    You might want to handle this event in a custom control
 *    definition if your control definition has special behavior after
 *    the control has been tracked. You can also handle this event in
 *    application code, to be notified after a control has been
 *    tracked; however, from the application level, it is generally
 *    preferred to provide a command ID for the control and handle
 *    kEventCommandProcess instead of kEventControlHit. Handling
 *    kEventCommandProcess is more generic and allows the same code to
 *    handle events from both controls and menu items.

 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is used for non-composited control drawing. When an

 *    If you at all wish to handle the drag, you must return true in

 *    handler in response to this event. If you return
 *    eventNotHandledErr, do not supply a
 *    kEventParamControlWouldAcceptDrop parameter, or set its value to
 *    false, you will not receive 'within' or 'leave' messages, nor

 *    operation.

    kEventClassService quick reference:
    
    Services are a feature by which applications can communicate with
    one another to request and provide services. This communication
    happens either through the Pasteboard or Scrap Manager. When an event is sent that 
    requires communication for processing or servicing a request, 
    you will need to use the pasteboard or scrap given in the kEventParamPasteboardRef and
    kEventParamScrapRef parameters of the event in order to communicate.
    When your app requests a service, it is usually acting on data that is 
    currently selected or in focus. Therefore all of the Services events 
    are sent to the UserFocus event target.
    <BR><BR>
    Service events are available on Mac OS X 10.1 and later.

/*
 *  GetEventMonitorTarget()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Returns the event monitor target.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The event monitor target is a special event target used to
 *    monitor user input events across all processes. When an event
 *    handler is installed on the event monitor target, the Carbon
 *    Event Manager examines the EventTypeSpec for user input event
 *    types, such as mouse-down, mouse-up, key-down, and so forth. It
 *    then requests that the WindowServer make copies of any of these
 *    events that are sent to any process, and deliver them to the
 *    current process also. These events are queued into the main
 *    threadÕs event queue, and during normal event dispatching are
 *    sent directly to the event handlers installed on the event
 *    monitor target. Monitored events are not sent through the normal
 *    event dispatching path for the current process; they will pass
 *    through the event dispatcher target, and will then be sent
 *    directly to the event monitor target.
 *    
 *    Handlers installed on the event monitor target will only receive
 *    events when the current application is inactive. When the current
 *    application is active, all event flow occurs through the event
 *    dispatcher target, and no events are sent to the event monitor
 *    target.
 *    
 *    Currently, the event monitor supports the following event kinds:
 *    kEventRawKeyDown, kEventRawKeyUp, kEventRawKeyRepeat,
 *    kEventRawKeyModifiersChanged, kEventMouseDown, kEventMouseUp,
 *    kEventMouseMoved, kEventMouseDragged, kEventMouseWheelMoved,
 *    kEventTabletPoint, and kEventTabletProximity.
 *    
 *    Note that both Carbon and Cocoa password edit text controls
 *    enable a secure input mode while the focus is on the control,
 *    which prevents keyboard events from being passed to other
 *    applications. This prevents the monitoring event target from
 *    being used to sniff password keystrokes.
 *    
 *    For added security, GetEventMonitorTarget requires that "Enable
 *    access for assistive devices" be checked in the Universal Access
 *    preference pane in order to monitor RawKeyDown, RawKeyUp, and
 *    RawKeyRepeat events. If this control is not checked, you can
 *    still install handlers for these events on the event monitor
 *    target, but no events of these types will be sent to your
 *    handler. Administrator privileges are required to enable this
 *    feature.

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    ProcessHICommand is a convenience function for dispatching
 *    kEventCommandProcesss events. Normally these events are created
 *    and dispatched automatically by the toolbox when a menu item or
 *    control is selected, but you may need to dispatch an event
 *    yourself at times. This API creates a CommandProcess event, adds
 *    the specified HICommand structure as an event parameter, and
 *    sends the event to the user focus target for handling. 
 *    
 *    If you need to send a CommandProcess event to some other target,
 *    or you need to add other event parameters to the event besides
 *    the HICommand structure, it is correct and supported to simply
 *    create the event yourself and send it to the desired target,
 *    without using this API.

 *  MouseTrackingRef
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    A MouseTrackingRef is an object that controls the generation of
 *    mouse-enter and mouse-exit events. When the user moves the mouse
 *    into a tracking region, a kEventClassMouse/kEventMouseEntered
 *    event is sent to the app. When the user moves the mouse out of a
 *    tracking region, an event of type
 *    kEventClassMouse/kEventMouseExited is sent. Mouse tracking
 *    regions are uniquely identified within the scope of a window by a
 *    MouseTrackingRegionID which is a client signature/id pair. The
 *    client signature is the usual DTS-registered creator OSType.
 *    Mouse tracking regions can overlap, but are not exclusive. Mouse
 *    motion events are generated for each of the tracking areas
 *    intersected by the mouse. Mouse tracking regions are initially
 *    enabled. You can explicitly disable a mouse tracking area to
 *    prevent mouse-enter/exit events from being generated. Unlike
 *    global mouse-moved events, mouse-enter and mouse-exit events are
 *    generated while your app is in the background. If this is not
 *    considered desirable, disable the tracking areas while the
 *    application is in the background. MouseTrackingRefs become
 *    invalid when the window that they are bound to is disposed of.
