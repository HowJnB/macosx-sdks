/*
 *  HIAboutBox()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Displays an HI-conformant about box.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This about box is a generic about box that automatically can
 *    display your application name, version string, and copyright
 *    string. It peeks into either the Info.plist or your bundle
 *    resource (not recommended) to get the information by default. You
 *    can customize what it displays by passing in various options in
 *    the input dictionary.
 *    There are three basic ways to call this function. First, you can
 *    pass NULL for inOptions. As mentioned, default information will
 *    be displayed. Second, you can pass the actual values for the
 *    strings displayed by passing the strings in the inOptions
 *    dictionary using the keys provided, such as kHIAboutBoxNameKey.
 *    If a replacement string is not passed, the default behavior kicks
 *    in. For example, you could pass some variant of your application
 *    name in the dictionary, but not pass a replacement version or
 *    copyright strings. The Toolbox would display your replacement
 *    string, and fall back to looking in the Info.plist for the other
 *    strings. The third way to call this is to pass the name of a
 *    string file in the dictionary with the key
 *    kHIAboutBoxStringFileKey. We will automatically use that file to
 *    find the strings for the about box. The keys in the string file
 *    should be the same value as the keys you would use to pass into
 *    the inOptions dictionary. Again, if a string is not found in that
 *    file, we would fall back to looking for a string in the
 *    dictionary, and then finally the Info.plist.
 *    Certainly this is not the be-all-end-all of about boxes, but it
 *    does provide a simple no-work about box for your application. The
 *    standard Toolbox application handler now responds to the
 *    kHICommandAbout command ID by calling HIAboutBox for you. This
 *    means that any Carbon Event-based application will get this
 *    behavior for free right out of the box. If you wish for the
 *    window to respond to cmd-W in the menu bar, you should be sure
 *    that menu item has the kHICommandClose commandID.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Not thread safe
 *
