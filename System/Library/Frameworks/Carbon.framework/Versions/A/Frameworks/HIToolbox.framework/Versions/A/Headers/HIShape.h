/*
 *  HIShape
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    HIShape is an abstract shape object for use with some of the
 *    HIToolbox APIs. It is designed as a replacement for RgnHandles
 *    (though it is currently implemented in terms of them at the time
 *    of this writing). This abstraction will allow us to avoid using
 *    QD types in our APIs, particularly in HIView. 
 *    
 *    One of the biggest benefits of HIShape is that we have mutable
 *    and immutable variants. This means that immutable shapes can be
 *    created and passed around and 'copied' very quickly, since they
 *    are actually refcounted when copied. This avoids needing to do
 *    the handle-to-handle copies that occur right now with
 *    RgnHandle-based APIs.
