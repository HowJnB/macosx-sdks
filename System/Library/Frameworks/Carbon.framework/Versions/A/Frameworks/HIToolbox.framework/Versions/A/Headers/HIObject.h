/*
 *  HIObject
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    HIObject is the HIToolbox's base class for various objects. Over
 *    time, all of our common objects (controls, windows, menus, etc.)
 *    will be derived from HIObject. Code which is external to
 *    HIToolbox can also create its own subclasses of our objects using
 *    the routines contained in this file. There are also polymorphic
 *    functions one can use on any HIObject for getting the class ID,
 *    etc. 
 *    
 *    HIObjects are actually CF types under the hood. This means that
 *    they can be put into CF collections and retain/release can be
 *    called on them. 
 *    
 *    An HIObject is essentially a very basic building-block object
 *    which contains an event target. You can create these objects to
 *    use as your own Carbon Event receptors in your application, or
 *    you can subclass existing Toolbox object to suit your needs.
 *    
 *    
 *    You register your subclasses with HIObjectRegisterSubclass,
 *    passing your class ID, the parent class, and an event handler.
 *    You also pass a list of events the handler is interested in.
 *    
 *    
 *    To create an object of your subclass, you call HIObjectCreate,
 *    passing the class ref you registered, as well as an
 *    initialization event. 
 *    
 *    Construction is two-phase: first the basic construction of the
 *    object is done, then initialization is performed. The toolbox
 *    sends construction events bottom-up, as you would expect in C++
 *    or the like. Here is the list of what goes on to create an
 *    object: 
 *    
 *    1)  The Toolbox creates the base HIObject 
 *    
 *    2)  It then installs the event handler you specified when you
 *    registered your subclass. Your handler must listen for
 *    kEventHIObjectConstruct and kEventHIObjectDestruct events. If it
 *    does not, the class cannot be registered (you will get a
 *    paramErr). 
 *    
 *    3)  Next, the Toolbox _directly_ calls your handler with an
 *    kEventHIObjectConstruct event. When called like this, you are not
 *    really being called in the context of a handler stack, so you
 *    cannot do things like CallNextEventHandler. The userData
 *    parameter is what you specified when you registered the class.
 *    Typically, during construction you will allocate memory yourself
 *    to store your own instance data; this allocation might be as
 *    simple as calling malloc or NewPtr, or it might involve creating
 *    your own C++ object. In the construct event, you are passed the
 *    base HIObjectRef of the object being created. Typically you would
 *    store this HIObjectRef in your own instance data for later use.
 *    When handling this construct event, you should be sure to use
 *    SetEventParameter to set the kEventParamHIObjectInstance
 *    parameter in the construction event with your own instance data.
 *    You must use typeVoidPtr as the type. 
 *    
 *    4)  The Toolbox looks for your instance of typeVoidPtr after you
 *    handle the construct event. It then takes that data and stores it
 *    off with the object and also sets the user data of the event
 *    handler it installed to be this instance data. This means that
 *    following the construct event, all calls to your event handler
 *    will have the instance data you returned to us. 
 *    
 *    5)  Once construction has completed successfully, we will send
 *    your object the initialize event passed into HIObjectCreate. At
 *    this point, all events are now sent to your object using standard
 *    Carbon Events mechanisms (it is only the construct event which is
 *    special). When we send the initialization event to your subclass,
 *    you should pass the event to your superclass before proceeding.
 *    You do this with CallNextEventHandler. Once back from that call,
 *    you should verify that the result is noErr, indicating that the
 *    superclass did in fact initialize properly. If it did not, your
 *    should return the error that CallNextEventHandler returned from
 *    your handler as well. The object will be destroyed by the
 *    Toolbox. Your object should be able to be destroyed in a
 *    partially initialized state such as this. This stage is optional,
 *    i.e. an object does not need to respond to the initialize event
 *    unless it is expecting certain parameters to be passed to it at
 *    creation time. This is where those parameters can be fetched.
 *    
 *    
 *    6)  Once initialization is successful, the HIObjectRef is
 *    returned to the caller of HIObjectCreate. From there, you can
 *    have all sorts of cool fun. 
 *    
 *    When someone has called CFRelease enough such that the refcount
 *    of the object drops to zero, the object is destroyed. The Toolbox
 *    will send a kEventHIObjectDestruct event to your object. DO NOT
 *    CALL CALLNEXTEVENTHANDLER. You will be setting yourself up for
 *    some hurt. Just clean up and return from your handler.

 *          will read this parameter from the event and store it in

 *          
 *          On exit, this parameter is typeVoidPtr, and should be a

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Your handler should pass this event on to the superclass first
 *    before handling this event. This is done by calling
 *    CallNextEventHandler with the event. When that function returns,
 *    you should make sure the result is noErr. If not, you should NOT
 *    continue to initialize your class.
 *    
 *    Assuming that CallNextEventHandler returned noErr, you may then
 *    proceed to read initialization data from the event parameters, if
 *    any. For example, you might be create an object that includes a
 *    string as part of its instance data. The caller of HIObjectCreate
 *    would create an EventRef and add a string to the event using a
 *    parameter name and type defined by your object. In your object’s
 *    kEventHIObjectInitialize event handler, you would read the string
 *    from the event parameter and store it into your instance
 *    data.
 *    
 *    The parameters of this event, therefore, contain the union of all

 *    
 *    inOptions:
 *      Any special options for your class. Currently you must pass 0
 *      for this parameter.
 *    
 *    inConstructProc:
 *      The construction proc for this subclass. You pass the address
 *      of an event handler into this parameter. This handler is called
 *      directly, rather than through the normal event dispatching
 *      mechanism. This means that the EventHandlerCallRef passed in

 *      HIObjectCreate on the class ID will return
 *      hiObjectClassIsAbstractErr.
 *    
 *    inNumEvents:
 *      The number of events you are installing.
 *    
 *    inEventList:
 *      The events your handler wishes to receive. You must handle the
 *      kEventHIObjectConstruct and kEventHIObjectDestruct event. If
 *      these events are not specified, an error is returned.
 *    
 *    inConstructData:
 *      Pass any info you want passed into your event handler here. For
 *      a C++ hierarchy based on HIObjects, you might actually pass a
 *      static method to construct your object here, and the base class
 *      event handler to do construction as your event handler.

 *  HIObjectCreateFromBundle()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Returns the HIObject for the given bundle. A bundle can be
 *    designed to communicate with an app through an HIObject. The
 *    bundle must be designed to create an HIObject and have a defined
 *    suite of CarbonEvents that clients can use to communicate with
 *    the bundle's HIObject. Given a CFBundleRef, this API will tell
 *    the bundle to create the HIObject and return it to the caller.

 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inBundle:
 *      The bundle that you wish to communicate with.
 *    
 *    outObject:
 *      The HIObject associated with the bundle.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system result code. If the bundle's HIObject
 *    creation function cannot be found, cfragNoSymbolErr will be
 *    returned.

/*
 *  HIObjectSetAccessibilityIgnored()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Marks an HIObject as ignored (or not) for the purposes of the
 *    accessibility APIs. 
 *    
 *    An HIObject that is ignored for accessibility will never be shown
 *    to an assistive application that uses the accessibility APIs to
 *    examine an interface. Your application's accessibility
 *    implementation can (and should) still report an ignored HIObject
 *    as usual. Carbon's accessibility engine will automatically prune
 *    any ignored HIObjects out of the data that is shown to an
 *    assistive application. 
 *    <BR>By default, an HIObject is *not* accessibility ignored.

 *  Mac OS X threading:
