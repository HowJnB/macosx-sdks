.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This depends on Metal\&.framework  Specifies the average pooling filter\&. For each pixel, returns the mean value of pixels in the kernelWidth x kernelHeight filter region\&. When \fBedgeMode\fP is \fBMPSImageEdgeModeClamp\fP the filtering window is shrunk to remain 
.SH "within the source image borders\&. What this means is that close to image borders the filtering window"
.PP
.PP
will be smaller in order to fit inside the source image and less values will be used to compute the average\&. In case the filtering window is entirely outside the source image border the outputted value will be zero\&.
