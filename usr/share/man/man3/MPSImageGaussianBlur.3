.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBMPSImageGaussianBlur\fP convolves an image with gaussian of given sigma in both x and y direction\&. 
.PP
.nf
            The MPSImageGaussianBlur utilizes a very fast algorith that typically runs at approximately
            1/2 of copy speeds. Notably, it is faster than either the tent or box blur except perhaps
            for very large filter windows. Mathematically, it is an approximate gaussian. Some
            non-gaussian behavior may be detectable with advanced analytical methods such as FFT.  
            If a analytically clean gaussian filter is required, please use the MPSImageConvolution 
            filter instead with an appropriate set of weights. The MPSImageGaussianBlur is intended
            to be suitable for all common image processing needs demanding ~10 bits of precision or
            less.

Reimplemented from \fBMPSKernel\fP\&.
.SS "\- (nonnull instancetype) \fBinitWithDevice:\fP (nonnull id< MTLDevice >) device(float) NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER"
Initialize a gaussian blur filter for a particular sigma and device 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIdevice\fP The device the filter will run on 
.br
\fIsigma\fP The standard deviation of gaussian blur filter\&. Gaussian weight, centered at 0, at integer grid i is given as w(i) = 1/sqrt(2*pi*sigma) * exp(-i^2/2*sigma^2) If we take cut off at 1% of w(0) (max weight) beyond which weights are considered 0, we have ceil (sqrt(-log(0\&.01)*2)*sigma) ~ ceil(3\&.7*sigma) as rough estimate of filter width
