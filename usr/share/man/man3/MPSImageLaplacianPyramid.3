.PP 
The Laplacian image pyramid is constructed from the Gaussian pyramid\&. At level 'l' of the pyramid the level 'l+1' of the Gaussian pyramid is expanded to double its size by duplicating the rows and columns of the the level, then filtered with the same convolution kernel as the Gaussian pyramid and finally subtracted from the level 'l' of the Gaussian pyramid\&.
.PP
When encoding the Laplacian image pyramid kernel to the commandbuffer one must pass as the source image the Gaussian image pyramid, which is used to construct the Laplacian pyramid\&. If the source image contains mipmap levels up to level 'l', then the Laplacian pyramid will be constructed up to mipmap level 'l-1', or up to the level present in the destination image in case it is lower than 'l-1'\&.
