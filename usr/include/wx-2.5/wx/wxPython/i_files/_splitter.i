Styles
-------
    ====================   ======================================
    wx.SP_3D               Draws a 3D effect border and sash.
    wx.SP_3DSASH           Draws a 3D effect sash.
    wx.SP_3DBORDER         Synonym for wxSP_BORDER.
    wx.SP_BORDER           Draws a standard border.
    wx.SP_NOBORDER         No border (default).
    wx.SP_NO_XP_THEME      Under Windows XP, switches off the
                           attempt to draw the splitter
                           using Windows XP theming, so the
                           borders and sash will take on the
                           pre-XP look.
    wx.SP_PERMIT_UNSPLIT   Always allow to unsplit, even with
                           the minimum pane size other than zero.
    wx.SP_LIVE_UPDATE      Don't draw XOR line but resize the
                           child windows immediately.
    ====================   ======================================

Events
------
    ==============================  =======================================
    EVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGING  The sash position is in the
                                    process of being changed. May be
                                    used to modify the position of
                                    the tracking bar to properly
                                    reflect the position that would
                                    be set if the drag were to be
                                    completed at this point.

    EVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGED
                                    The sash position was
                                    changed. May be used to modify
                                    the sash position before it is
                                    set, or to prevent the change
                                    from taking place. 

    EVT_SPLITTER_UNSPLIT            The splitter has been just unsplit.

    EVT_SPLITTER_DCLICK             The sash was double clicked. The
                                    default behaviour is to unsplit
                                    the window when this happens
                                    (unless the minimum pane size has
                                    been set to a value greater than
                                    zero.)
